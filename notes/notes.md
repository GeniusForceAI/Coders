# Genius Force: Engineering the Future with AI
(Also known as: GForce)

## Concept Overview
An animated educational series targeting software engineers and developers, featuring three brilliant tech experts who solve real-world engineering problems using AI, electromagnetics, and digital concepts. The show follows our heroes as they discover problems through their Reddit Smart Aggregator, visit the mysterious Data Store to find relevant datasets, and build innovative solutions using AI tools. Each episode connects to comprehensive tutorials on the GForce docusaurus website and drives engagement toward high-ticket offerings.

## Core Elements

### The Data Store
A mystical tech hub where all the world's datasets converge. Represented as a vast, digital library with:
- Interactive data visualizations
- Real-time data streams
- AI-powered data discovery tools
- Cross-domain data connections
The Data Store serves as a metaphor for the comprehensive dataset collection detailed in our lead magnet.

### Reddit Smart Aggregator
The team's custom-built intelligence tool that:
- Monitors subreddits from Top 100 US Universities
  - University-specific subreddits (e.g., r/MIT, r/Stanford, r/Berkeley)
  - Local city/community subreddits (e.g., r/boston, r/paloalto, r/bayarea)
- Analyzes discussions from America's top intellectual communities
- Identifies emerging technical challenges and research directions
- Tracks cross-pollination of ideas between academic institutions
- Maps problem patterns across different regions and universities
- Correlates academic discussions with industry trends from Devpost
- Suggests dataset combinations based on university research patterns
- Provides insight into cutting-edge academic-industry challenges

The Aggregator serves as a unique window into the minds of America's future tech leaders and researchers, helping identify problems worth solving before they become mainstream.
