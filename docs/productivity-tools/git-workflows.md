title: Effective Git Workflows for Enhanced Development with Shippi
---

## Introduction

Git workflows are a crucial aspect of modern development, providing the structure necessary for collaborative coding and version management. By integrating Shippi's AI-enhanced capabilities, teams can improve their git workflows, making processes more efficient and reducing the cognitive load on developers. This documentation explores various git workflows and how they can be enhanced using Shippi.

## 1. Basic Git Workflow

For new teams or small projects, a basic git workflow involves:
- **Single Master Branch:** All changes are committed directly to the `master` branch.
- **Frequent Pull Requests:** Developers frequently create pull requests to ensure code quality.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Use AI prompts from Shippi to get immediate feedback on pull requests.

### Example:

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone <repository-url>

# Create a new branch
$ git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make changes and commit
$ git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Push the branch and create a pull request
$ git push origin feature/new-feature
```

## 2. Feature Branch Workflow

In more complex projects, using a feature branch workflow helps manage project complexity:
- **Main Branch:** Reserved for production-ready code.
- **Feature Branches:** Created for each new feature or hotfix.
- **Shippi AI Integration:** Leveraging AI-assisted code reviews to maintain code quality and consistency.

### Example:
```bash
# Checkout a new feature branch from main
$ git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature

# Once ready, merge back to main
$ git checkout main
$ git merge feature/amazing-feature
$ git push origin main
```

## 3. Gitflow Workflow

The Gitflow workflow is a robust approach for managing projects, especially those in the release phase:
- **Develop Branch:** Integration branch for features.
- **Master Branch:** Reflects production-ready state.
- **AI-Powered Merge Strategies:** Use Shippi's AI to intelligently manage merges and conflict resolution.

### Example Structure:
```
- master
- develop
- feature/
- hotfix/
- release/
```

## 4. Forking Workflow

Particularly useful for open-source projects or distributed teams. Each developer:
- Works off their fork, creating personal branches.
- Uses pull requests for merging changes.
- **AI Meeting Summarizations:** Utilize meeting summarization for async planning.

### Example:
```bash
# Fork the repository
$ git clone <forked-repository-url>

# Create a branch for a new feature
$ git checkout -b feature/readme-update

# Push and open a pull request to the original repo
$ git push origin feature/readme-update
```

## 5. CI/CD Pipeline Integration

With Shippi, integrating a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflow with git ensures robust deployment processes:
- **Automated Testing:** Trigger automated tests on each push.
- **Shippi-Driven Analytics:** Analyze which branches are production-ready using Shippi’s performance metrics.

## Code Review with Shippi

Enhance your code reviews using Shippi’s AI capabilities:
- **Automated Suggestions:** Shippi provides coded improvement suggestions in real time.
- **Reduced Review Cycle:** AI prompts streamline feedback, reducing cycle times.

## Conclusion

By using optimized git workflows, teams can streamline their development processes, reduce errors, and maintain high code quality. Shippi's AI tools integrate seamlessly, providing enhanced automation and cognitive load reduction. Consider implementing these strategies in your projects to maximize efficiency.

## Quick AI Prompt Example

Use the following prompt to get started with AI-assisted code review:

```
"Analyze the code quality and potential improvements for the branch 'feature/amazing-feature'."
```

## Using Shippi VSCode Extension

The Shippi VSCode extension simplifies these workflows by integrating AI responses directly within your editor. Install it to enhance your git workflow right inside your development environment.
