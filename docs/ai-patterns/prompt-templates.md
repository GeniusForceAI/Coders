## Introduction to Prompt Templates

Prompt templates are pre-defined text structures designed to standardize the way you communicate with AI systems. They help streamline interactions by providing a consistent format that AI can understand, resulting in more accurate and relevant outputs. In the context of AI-enhanced development workflows, using prompt templates can reduce cognitive load, save time, and improve the consistency of AI-generated outputs.

### The Role of Prompt Templates

Prompt templates serve several key purposes:
- **Standardization:** By using predefined templates, developers ensure a uniform approach to AI queries, making responses predictable and reliable.
- **Efficiency:** Templates speed up interactions with AI, as they reduce the need to craft new prompts for each task. This is especially useful in iterative tasks such as code reviews or documentation.
- **Precision:** Well-designed templates guide the AI to generate more precise results by setting clear expectations.

## Creating Effective Prompt Templates

### Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**
- Clearly define the task or question within the template. A specific prompt leads to a more focused response.
    
    ```plaintext
    "Summarize the following code and explain its purpose: 
    [code snippet]"
    ```

2. **Use Examples**
- If applicable, include examples of expected output to clarify the desired result.
    
    ```plaintext
    "Transform this SQL query into a MongoDB query. Example of SQL:
    [SQL snippet]
    Expected MongoDB equivalent"
    ```

3. **Structure Properly**
- Break down the prompt into logical sections to handle complex requests. This aids in maintaining clarity and focus.
    
    ```plaintext
    "## Task:
- Review the code for optimization.
- Highlight any security vulnerabilities.
    ## Code:
    [code snippet]"
    ```

4. **Incorporate Feedback Loops**
- Include sections for feedback or iterative improvements.
    
    ```plaintext
    "Generate a first draft of the component documentation, then:
- Revise according to the feedback:
    [Feedback notes]"
    ```

### Example: Code Review Template

```plaintext
"Code Review - Checklist:

1. Syntax Errors: 
- Check for missing semicolons or unmatched brackets.

2. Performance Improvements: 
- Identify any potential loops that can be optimized.

3. Security Considerations: 
- Look for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Code to review:
[code snippet]"
```

## Implementing Prompt Templates with Shippi

Leveraging prompt templates within Shippi's VSCode extension can enhance your workflow significantly. By setting up templates:
- Save commonly used prompts in your extension settings for easy access.
- Use templates to automate repetitive tasks such as code analysis, documentation drafting, or meeting summarization.

### Sample AI Prompt Setup in Shippi

To set up a simple prompt template for Shippi:

1. **Navigate to Extension Settings**
2. **Create New Template**
- Name: "Bug Report Template"
- Content:
    
    ```plaintext
    "Report a Bug - Template:
- Description of Issue:
- Steps to Reproduce:
- Expected Outcome:
- Actual Outcome:

    Relevant Code:
    [code snippet]"
    ```

3. **Save and Use**
- This template can now be quickly utilized whenever a new bug report is generated.

## Conclusion

Prompt templates are powerful tools that can facilitate effective and efficient interaction with AI systems. By incorporating them into your development workflows using Shippi, you can ensure that your team leverages AI to its fullest potential, while maintaining consistency and precision.
