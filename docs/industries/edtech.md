  }

  calculateNextReview(item) {
    const {lastReviewDate, successCount, failCount} = item;
    
    // Calculate success rate
    const totalAttempts = successCount + failCount;
    const successRate = totalAttempts > 0 ? successCount / totalAttempts : 0;
    
    // Determine current level
    let level = Math.min(
      Math.floor(successCount / 2),
      this.intervals.length - 1
    );
    
    // Adjust level based on success rate
    if (successRate < 0.6) {
      level = Math.max(0, level - 1);
    }
    
    // Calculate next review date
    const interval = this.intervals[level];
    const nextReview = new Date(lastReviewDate);
    nextReview.setDate(nextReview.getDate() + interval);
    
    return {
      nextReviewDate: nextReview,
      interval,
      level
    };
  }

  recordReviewResult(item, success) {
    return {
      ...item,
