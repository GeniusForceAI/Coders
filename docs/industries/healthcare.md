   - Requires risk analysis and management
   - Mandates access controls and audit trails

3. **Breach Notification Rule**
   - Defines requirements for reporting data breaches
   - Establishes timelines and procedures for notification

### Implementation Strategies

```javascript
// Example: HIPAA-compliant data access logging
const accessHealthRecord = async (patientId, userId, reason) => {
  // Verify authorization
  const authorized = await AuthService.checkAccess(userId, patientId, 'read');
  if (!authorized) {
    // Log unauthorized access attempt
    await SecurityService.logAccessAttempt({
      patientId,
      userId,
      action: 'read',
      authorized: false,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      reason
    });
    throw new UnauthorizedAccessError('Not authorized to access this record');
  }
  
  // Log authorized access
  await SecurityService.logAccessAttempt({
    patientId,
    userId,
    action: 'read',
    authorized: true,
    timestamp: new Date(),
    reason
  });
  
  // Retrieve and return the record
  const record = await PatientRepository.getRecord(patientId);
  return record;
};
```
