# AI-Assisted Code Generation

## Introduction

AI-assisted code generation is one of Windsurf's most powerful features, allowing developers to create code faster and with fewer errors by leveraging artificial intelligence. This guide explains how to effectively use Windsurf's code generation capabilities to accelerate your development workflow.

## Understanding AI Code Generation

Windsurf's code generation is powered by large language models (LLMs) specifically trained on programming tasks. These models can:

- Generate complete functions, classes, and modules based on descriptions
- Complete code as you type with context-aware suggestions
- Transform high-level descriptions into working implementations
- Convert between programming languages
- Generate tests for existing code
- Create documentation for your code

The AI understands the context of your project, including:
- The programming language and framework
- Your project structure and dependencies
- Coding patterns you've established
- Your coding style and naming conventions

## Code Generation Methods

### 1. Inline Completions

As you type, Windsurf offers suggestions to complete your code:

- **Activation**: Suggestions appear automatically or when pressing `Ctrl+Space` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Space` (macOS)
- **Navigation**: Use `Tab` to accept suggestions, arrow keys to navigate between options
- **Customization**: Adjust suggestion frequency and depth in Settings

**Pro Tip**: To get better inline completions, add descriptive comments before your code explaining what you want to accomplish.

### 2. Command-Based Generation

Generate entire code blocks using natural language descriptions:

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Type "Generate Code" and select the option
3. Enter a description of what you want to create
4. Review and modify the generated code

**Example**: "Create a React component that displays a paginated list of products with filtering options"

### 3. Comment-Driven Generation

Use special comment syntax to trigger code generation:

```javascript
// @generate: Create a function that validates email addresses
```

After typing this comment and pressing Enter, Windsurf will generate the requested code below the comment.

### 4. Context Menu Generation

Generate code for specific tasks through the editor context menu:

1. Right-click in the editor
2. Select "Generate with AI"
3. Choose the type of generation (function, class, test, etc.)
4. Provide a description
5. Review and accept the generated code

### 5. AI Chat Interface

Use the conversational interface for more complex generation tasks:

1. Open the AI Assistant panel
2. Describe what you want to create
3. Discuss and refine the requirements through conversation
4. Insert the final code directly from the chat

## Code Generation Capabilities

### Function and Method Generation

```
Generate a function that:
- Takes a list of products and filter criteria
- Returns filtered products based on price range, category, and availability
- Handles edge cases like empty lists or invalid filters
```

### Class and Component Generation

```
Create a React component for a user profile page that:
- Displays user information (name, avatar, bio)
- Shows activity history
- Includes edit functionality
- Has responsive design for mobile and desktop
```

### API Integration

```
Generate code to integrate with the Stripe payment API to:
- Create payment intents
- Process credit card payments
- Handle success and failure states
- Store transaction records
```

### Database Operations

```
Create a set of MongoDB CRUD operations for a user entity with:
- Schema definition
- Create, read, update, delete functions
- Indexing for optimal performance
- Validation and error handling
```

### Test Generation

```
Generate unit tests for the authentication service that:
- Tests successful login/logout flows
- Validates token generation and verification
- Tests error cases like invalid credentials
- Includes mocks for external dependencies
```

## Best Practices for Effective Code Generation

### 1. Be Specific and Detailed

The quality of generated code directly correlates with the clarity and specificity of your prompts. Include:

- Input and output specifications
- Error handling requirements
- Performance considerations
- Dependencies and interactions with other code

**Example**:
Instead of: "Generate a sorting function"
Better: "Generate a function that sorts an array of product objects by price, date, or name, with an option for ascending or descending order"

### 2. Iterate and Refine

Treat AI code generation as a collaborative process:

1. Start with a high-level request
2. Review the generated code
3. Ask for specific modifications or improvements
4. Repeat until satisfied

### 3. Provide Context

Help the AI understand your specific needs:

- Reference existing code or patterns in your project
- Specify frameworks or libraries you're using
- Mention coding standards or architectural constraints

### 4. Use Comments to Guide Generation

Add detailed comments before generation to guide the AI:

```javascript
// Create a user authentication function that:
// 1. Takes username and password
// 2. Validates input (non-empty, password min 8 chars)
// 3. Checks credentials against the database
// 4. Returns a JWT token on success
// 5. Handles errors for invalid credentials or server issues
```

### 5. Generate in Smaller Parts

For complex features, break the generation into manageable pieces:

- Generate the data model first
- Then create the business logic
- Finally, build the user interface
- Integrate the pieces with additional guidance

## Advanced Generation Techniques

### Template-Based Generation

Create reusable templates for common patterns:

1. Create a code snippet with placeholders
2. Use the "Generate from Template" command
3. Describe how to fill in the placeholders

```javascript
// @template: AsyncDataFetcher
async function fetch{{ResourceName}}({{parameters}}) {
  try {
    const response = await api.get('/{{endpoint}}', { {{params}} });
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    handleError(error);
    return [];
  }
}
```

### Multi-File Generation

Generate related files as a set:

1. Use the "Generate Feature" command
2. Describe the complete feature
3. Let Windsurf create all necessary files (component, styles, tests, etc.)

### Interactive Generation

For more complex requirements, use interactive mode:

1. Start a generation task
2. Windsurf will ask clarifying questions
3. Provide additional details as requested
4. Review and accept the final result

## Language-Specific Generation

### JavaScript/TypeScript

Generate typical JS/TS constructs:
- React/Vue/Angular components
- Express/NestJS endpoints
- TypeScript interfaces and types
- Jest/Mocha test suites

### Python

Generate Python-specific code:
- Flask/Django routes and views
- Data analysis with Pandas
- Machine learning with TensorFlow/PyTorch

2. Navigate to "AI > Code Generation > Style Preferences"
3. Customize options like:
   - Bracket style (same line vs. new line)
   - Quotes (single vs. double)
   - Semicolon usage
   - Comments style
   - Variable naming conventions

### Quality Settings

Adjust the tradeoff between speed and quality:

- **Draft Mode**: Quick generation with potential issues
- **Standard Mode**: Balanced approach suitable for most needs

### Learning from Your Code

Windsurf can adapt to your coding style:

1. Enable "Learn from Edits" in settings
2. As you modify generated code, Windsurf learns your preferences
3. Future generations will better match your style

## Troubleshooting

### Low-Quality Generation

If the generated code doesn't meet your expectations:

1. Provide more detailed requirements
2. Check that you've selected the appropriate language/framework
3. Try generating smaller, more focused pieces of code
4. Adjust the quality settings to "Thorough"

### Incorrect Imports or Dependencies

If the generated code has import issues:

1. Specify the exact libraries and versions you're using
2. Ensure your project's dependencies are correctly set up
3. Use "Fix Imports" to correct any issues automatically

### Performance Concerns

If code generation is slow:

1. Use a more efficient AI model in Settings
2. Generate smaller code segments
3. Check your internet connection
4. Consider local model options if available

## Ethical Considerations

When using AI-generated code:

- **Review All Code**: Understand what's being incorporated into your project
- **Test Thoroughly**: AI-generated code may contain subtle issues
- **Attribution**: Consider how to handle attribution for generated code
- **Security**: Verify that generated code doesn't introduce vulnerabilities
