## Introduction to Requirements Analysis

Requirements analysis is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle that involves gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and specifications of stakeholders. Accurate requirements analysis ensures that the final product aligns with user needs and project goals.

### Evolvement of Requirements Analysis with AI

Traditional requirements analysis can be a time-consuming task that involves intensive manual effort. With the introduction of AI into the workflow, it is now possible to streamline this process considerably. Shippi leverages AI to enhance the accuracy of requirements gathering, reduce time to market, and improve collaboration among stakeholders.

## Key Concepts in Requirements Analysis

### 1. Gathering Requirements

The initial stage involves collecting detailed information from stakeholders. This can be accomplished through meetings, interviews, surveys, and document analysis.

#### AI-Enhanced Gathering

Using AI, Shippi can automatically extract key points from meeting transcriptions, surveys, and documents, creating an organized list of requirements.
- **Prompt Example:** "Summarize the key points discussed in today's meeting about the new feature requirements."

### 2. Analyzing Requirements

This step involves interpreting stakeholder needs to identify conflicting requirements, prioritize tasks, and ensure feasibility.

#### AI-Driven Analysis

AI tools in Shippi can help categorize and prioritize requirements based on criteria such as complexity, urgency, and stakeholder importance.
- **Prompt Example:** "Categorize the recorded requirements by importance and feasibility."

```python
# Example script for prioritizing requirements using AI
import shippi_ai

requirements = [
    &#123;"name": "Feature A", "complexity": "High", "importance": "Core"&#125;,
    &#123;"name": "Feature B", "complexity": "Medium", "importance": "Nice to Have"&#125;,
]

prioritized_requirements = shippi_ai.prioritize_requirements(requirements)
print(prioritized_requirements)
```

### 3. Documenting Requirements

Accurate documentation is vital to ensure that all stakeholders have a consistent understanding of what is to be developed.

#### Automated Documentation

Shippi can automatically generate documents from analyzed data, maintaining consistency in format, and content structure, and providing automatically updated versions.
- **Prompt Example:** "Generate a report summarizing the finalized requirements for stakeholder review."

### 4. Validating and Verifying Requirements

Validation ensures that the documented requirements accurately articulate the stakeholder's needs, while verification ensures that they are feasible and testable.

#### AI-Assisted Validation

AI tools in Shippi can cross-reference industry standards and previous project outcomes to spot inconsistencies or potential issues early in the development process.
- **Prompt Example:** "Verify requirements against project constraints and industry standards."
