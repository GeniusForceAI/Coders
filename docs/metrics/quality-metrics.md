## Understanding Quality Metrics

### What are Quality Metrics?
Quality metrics are quantitative measures used to assess various aspects of a software project, including code quality, process efficiency, and team performance. These metrics help identify areas for improvement and ensure that software products meet the desired standards.

### Importance of Quality Metrics
- **Objective Assessment:** They offer an objective basis for evaluating the success and reliability of development processes.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Metrics provide insights that drive informed decisions for process enhancements.
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Facilitate clear reporting to stakeholders by quantifying aspects of project quality.

## Key Quality Metrics

### Code Quality Metrics
1. **Code Complexity:** Measures the complexity of the codebase to ensure readability and maintainability.
- **Example Metric:** Cyclomatic Complexity - Tracks the number of linearly independent paths through the code.
   
   ```javascript
   function exampleFunction(x) &#123;
       if (x > 0) &#123;
           return x * 2;
       &#125; else &#123;
           return x - 2;
       &#125;
   &#125;
   // Cyclomatic Complexity = 2
   ```

2. **Code Coupling:** Assesses how interdependent the modules in the application are.
3. **Code Coverage:** Evaluates the proportion of the code executed by automated tests.

### Process Quality Metrics
1. **Lead Time:** Measures the time taken from feature request to delivery.
2. **Cycle Time:** Tracks the duration for a task to move from "in progress" to complete.
3. **Defect Density:** Indicates the number of defects per unit size of the software, often measured post-deployment.

### Team Performance Metrics
1. **Velocity:** Reflects the amount of work a team can complete in a given sprint.
2. **Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD):** Visualizes the flow of tasks through various stages of the workflow.
3. **Burn Rate:** Calculates the rate at which project resources are being used.
