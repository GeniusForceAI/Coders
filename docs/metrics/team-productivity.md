```

*Benefits*: Ensures that critical tasks are completed first, reducing bottlenecks.

### 2.2. Automated Documentation

Keeping documentation up-to-date can be tedious, yet it's vital for team alignment. Shippi automates documentation, ensuring accuracy and saving time.

**Code Example**:
```js
// Function to generate automatic documentation updates
function updateDocumentation(data) &#123;
  // AI-generated summary
  const summary = AI.generateSummary(data);
  // Save the summary to the project docs
  saveToDocs(summary);
&#125;
```

*Benefits*: Ensures up-to-date docs with minimal manual input, saving significant time.

### 2.3. AI-Assisted Code Reviews

Shippi's AI can help streamline the code review process by automatically flagging potential issues, ensuring coding standards, and providing suggestions.
