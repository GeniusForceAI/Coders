title: AI-Assisted Code Review with Shippi
---

## Overview

AI-Assisted Code Review is a powerful functionality within Shippi's suite of tools that leverages Artificial Intelligence to streamline and enhance the code review process. By integrating AI into your code review workflows, you can reduce cognitive load, ensure higher code quality, and improve the overall efficiency of your development team. This documentation will guide you through setting up, using, and maximizing the value of AI-assisted code reviews.

## Benefits of AI-Assisted Code Review
- **Automated Static Analysis**: AI can automatically analyze code for common issues, reducing the manual effort required from reviewers.
- **Contextual Feedback**: Provides feedback based on the historical context of code changes, enhancing relevance and accuracy.
- **Reduced Review Time**: Speeds up the review process by highlighting critical areas that need attention, enabling faster decision-making.
- **Increased Code Quality**: Ensures adherence to coding standards and identifies potential bugs before deployment.

## Setting Up AI-Assisted Code Review

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have the Shippi VSCode extension installed.
- Access to your project's version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

### Installation

1. Install the Shippi VSCode extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/).
2. Configure the extension with access credentials to your code repository.
3. Enable AI-Assisted Code Review through the extension settings panel.

### Configuration

```json
&#123;
  "aiCodeReview": &#123;
    "enable": true,
    "threshold": "medium",
    "languageSupport": ["javascript", "python", "java"],
    "customRules": "path/to/custom/rules.json"
  &#125;
&#125;
```
- `enable`: Set to `true` to activate AI-Assisted Code Review.
- `threshold`: Define the sensitivity level (`low`, `medium`, `high`) for issue detection.
- `languageSupport`: Specify languages in your project to optimize review processes.
- `customRules`: Path to a JSON file defining any custom review rules.

## Using AI-Assisted Code Review

### Start a Code Review Session

1. Open a pull request or commit you wish to review in VSCode.
2. Right-click and select **Start AI Code Review**.
3. The AI will generate feedback which will appear in the **Problems** pane in VSCode.
4. Review the AI suggestions by clicking on each item to navigate directly to the code segment.

### AI Prompts for Efficient Review
- "What are the top critical issues in this code?"
- "Can you summarize the most important changes made in this PR?"
- "Identify areas in this code that do not meet coding standards."

## Code Review Best Practices with AI

1. **Combine Human & AI Reviews**: Use AI to handle routine checks and focus human efforts on complex logic or architecture changes.
2. **Iteratively Improve AI Models**: Regularly update AI rules and models based on team feedback.
3. **Contextual Learning**: Encourage AI to learn from feedback to continually improve its suggestions.

## AI-Assisted Code Review in Action

### Example

Consider a JavaScript function that lacks adequate error handling. AI detects this and suggests improvements:

```javascript
function fetchData(url) &#123;
  return fetch(url)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .catch(error => console.error('Fetch error:', error));
&#125;
```

AI Feedback:
- "Consider implementing a retry mechanism in case of network failures."

## Tips for Maximizing AI-Assisted Code Review
- **Regularly Update AI Models**: Keep AI algorithms up to date with the latest coding standards and practices.
- **Integrate with CI/CD**: Incorporate AI-powered reviews into your pipeline to catch issues early.

## Conclusion

AI-Assisted Code Review is an invaluable tool in modern software development, offering significant improvements in quality and efficiency. By harnessing the power of AI, teams can focus on delivering exceptional code faster while maintaining high standards.
